# ðŸ§  Animal Image Classifier using TensorFlow (Cats, Dogs & Raccoons)

This is a small, practical project I built to get hands-on with TensorFlow and Keras. The goal was to create a simple neural network that can classify grayscale images into three categories: **cat**, **dog**, or **raccoon**.

For this first version (V1), I generated synthetic grayscale image data (28x28 pixels) just to keep things simple and focus on getting the core model architecture and training workflow right.
